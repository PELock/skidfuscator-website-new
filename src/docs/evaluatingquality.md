# Evaluating Quality

Making sure that an obfuscator produces a high quality output after applying obfuscation transformers is essential. At Skidfuscator, we assess various factors into what can affect the quality of obfuscated java code.

## Code size and complexity
The size and complexity of the obfuscated code are essential factors to consider when evaluating the quality of obfuscated Java code. Obfuscation should not significantly increase the size of the code, as this can lead to performance issues and potential bugs. At Skidfuscator, we aim to make your code as obscure as possible without significantly enlarging it whilst maintaining maximum security.

## Security
Security is a critical factor in evaluating the quality of obfuscated Java code. The obfuscation technique in question should be effective in protecting the code from reverse engineering attempts. This can be evaluated by analyzing the code's resistance to reverse engineering tools, such as decompilers and disassemblers.  

## Performance
The obfuscated code's performance is another crucial factor in evaluating its quality. Obfuscation should not significantly impact the code's execution time or memory usage. It is also important to note that the obfuscated code should not introduce any new bugs or errors that could affect the code's overall performance. Any performance issues introduced by the obfuscation technique should be identified and addressed.

## Summary 

Overall, the quality of obfuscated Java code can be evaluated based on several factors, including code size and complexity, security, maintainability, and performance. Obfuscation should not significantly impact any of these factors, and any issues introduced by the obfuscation technique should be identified and addressed promptly.
